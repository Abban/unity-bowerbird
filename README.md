*A Bowerbird's Nest of Unity3D scripts*

A set of resusable scripts and simple assets for Unity3D.

These are things I find myself using over and over again, so I thought I'd collect them in once place. I hope to continually evolve this into what I would regard "the missing Standard Assets".

The code here is a combination of that written by myself and code freely shared by others on the Unify Community wiki (http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Main_Page), the Unity forums (http://forum.unity3d.com/forum.php) and around the web. I've linked back to the original source at the top of each script, where appropriate.

All code *should* be free for commercial use in games without attribution - but check the license or URL at the top individual script to be sure.
